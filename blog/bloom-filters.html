          <p>
            Have you ever wondered how large-scale systems like Twitter,
            Facebook, or Instagram instantly check whether a username or email
            ID is already taken or not with thousands of requests per second to
            these systems?
          </p>

          <p>
            We could check the database that stores user records to see if a
            username or email ID is available, but this method is not very
            scalable as the number of records grows. With billions of records in
            the table, querying the databaseâ€™s tables can become a bottleneck
            for platforms like Twitter and Facebook, leading to performance
            issues when handling thousands of requests per second.
          </p>

          <p>
            Additionally, it can lead to poor user experience and is a very
            time-consuming task.
          </p>

          <p>
            One simple solution to this problem is to introduce a caching
            system. The caching system can reduce the number of times it hits
            the database each time a user requests availability. Caching can
            decrease the load on the database and significantly improve response
            time. It can help the system to scale efficiently by caching the
            data of repeating requests.
          </p>

          <p>
            But also, a cache system alone is not sufficient. If the cache is
            missing, the system has to hit the database. Also, what if a cache
            issue steals data? And also, caches consume memory, and if not
            properly managed, it can lead to excessive memory usage.
          </p>

          <p>
            So, what is the solution? The very efficient and scalable solution
            to this problem is Bloom Filters. Memory-efficient probabilistic
            data structure was introduced by computer scientist Howard Bloom in
            1970.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Bloom filters</strong> were introduced as a technique for a
            system to check the availability of an element in a set when the
            number of elements in the set requires an impractically large amount
            of memory. As you know, achieving something great comes with a cost.
            In this case, the price for efficiency is that this solution is
            probabilistic in nature. This means there might be some false
            positive results, where it might indicate that an element is in the
            set when it is not. However, it can never give false negative
            results, meaning it will never tell you that an element is not in
            the set when it actually is.
          </p>

          <p>
            One interesting aspect of bloom filters is that elements can be
            added to the set but not removed. As a result, the number of
            elements in the set continues to grow indefinitely, leading to a
            steadily increasing false positive rate.
          </p>

          <p>
            Bloom filters provide constant time performance for insertion and
            querying, making them an efficient solution for testing membership
            problems. Additionally, they can be easily distributed across
            multiple servers, making them well-suited for cloud-native
            distributed systems.
          </p>

          <h2>How Bloom Filter Works</h2>

          <p>
            Bloom filters use fixed-size m-bit arrays all set to 0 initially.
            Filter equipped with k-number of hash functions, which maps elements
            to one of possible m position in the bit array. These hash functions
            should be independent and uniformly distributed for optimal
            functioning of the bloom filter.
          </p>

          <p>
            Assume we want to insert an element into the set. First, we need to
            feed it to the k-hash functions, take the k-bit array positions, and
            turn those bits array positions to 1.
          </p>

          <p>
            To test whether an element is in the set, feed it to the k-hash
            functions to get the k-bit array positions. If any of the bits at
            these positions in the m-bit array is 0, then the element is
            definitely not in the set. But if all the k-bit array positions are
            1, then either the element is in the set or another element mapped
            to the same k-bit array positions, providing false positive results.
          </p>

          <img
            src="To test whether an element is in the set, feed it to the k-hash functions to get the k-bit array positions. If any of the bits at these positions in the m-bit array is 0, then the element is definitely not in the set. But if all the k-bit array positions are 1, then either the element is in the set or another element mapped to the same k-bit array positions, providing false positive results."

          />

          <img

            alt="Bloom Filter"
          />

          <p>
            Removing an element from this simple bloom filter is impossible
            because if we remove those k-bit array positions from the list,
            there is a chance that we also removed the elements that mapped to
            the same k-bit array positions. Although setting those k-bit array
            positions seems simple, it can introduce the possibility of false
            negatives, which is something we should avoid.
          </p>

          <p>Example of how bloom filter works</p>

          <p>
            Suppose we want to check if a book is available in a large online
            bookstore. Each book has a unique ISBN for identification. One way
            to do this is by searching the book data table. However, as the
            number of records increases, this method can become very
            time-consuming.
          </p>

          <p>
            We can introduce a bloom filter to tackle this problem. Letâ€™s assume
            we create a 10-bit array with 3 independent, uniformly distributed
            hash functions.
          </p>

          <p>arr = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]</p>

          <p>H(e) = {h1(e), h2(e), h3(e)}</p>

          <p>Let's assume we have added the two books with hashes below:</p>

          <p>H (Book A) = {1, 5, 8}</p>

          <p>H (Book B) = {2, 7, 9}</p>

          <p>Now the bit array looks like this</p>

          <p>arr = [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1]</p>

          <p>
            Now, if we want to check whether Book 3 is in the store, we can hash
            the bookâ€™s ISBN and take the 3-bit array positions like below:
          </p>

          <p>H (Book 3) = {3, 5, 9}</p>

          <p>arr[3] = 0, arr[5] = 1, arr[9] = 1</p>

          <p>
            There are one-bit positions that are not set to 1, and therefore
            Book 3 is not in the book store.
          </p>

          <p>But if another book, Book 4, gives the hashes like this:</p>

          <p>H (Book 4) = {2, 5, 9}</p>

          <p>arr[2] = 1, arr[5] = 1, arr[9] = 1</p>

          <p>
            In this case, we canâ€™t definitely say that the book is definitely in
            the store but with a false positive probability.
          </p>

          <h2>Choosing Good Hash Functions</h2>

          <p>
            It is important to design a k-different hash function for a bloom
            filter, but it can be challenging for large k values. A good hash
            function should be uniformly distributed and have little to no
            correlation with other hash functions. When using large m and k
            values, the independence constraint on hash functions can be relaxed
            with only a small increase in the false positive rate. Uniformity
            helps reduce the chance of collisions, thereby reducing the false
            positive rate.
          </p>

          <p>
            We can use cryptographic hash functions such as SHA-256 or md5 for
            their stability and uniform distribution, but they are slower, which
            can become a bottleneck for large systems with high request volumes.
          </p>

          <p>
            The best approach is to use non-cryptographic hash functions such as
            Murmur, FNV Series, Jenkins, and City hash functions. These hash
            functions are straightforward and provide uniformity, allowing for
            fast calculation of hashes.
          </p>

          <h2>Performance Consideration</h2>

          <p>
            Bloom filters have this unusual property that the time needed to
            insert an element and test the membership of an element is fixed.
            have O(k) complexity. Complexity is independent of the number of
            elements in the set. Hardware implementation of these bloom filters
            can provide excessively increased performance because k-lookups are
            independent and can be parallelized at the hardware level.
          </p>

          <p>
            Also, bloom filters are very memory/space efficient because they
            maintain a fixed-size bit array independent of the number of
            elements in the set.
          </p>

          <h2>Optimizing Bloom Filter</h2>

          <p>
            If we assume that each hash function selects each array position
            with equal probability and there is an m-bit array with k-hash
            functions, we can calculate the False Positive Rate using the below
            formula:
          </p>

          <img
            src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*wYp5gGCIqIaABMjb-d99sA.png"
            alt="False Positive Rate"
          />

          <p>
            Assuming we have a close approximation to the uniformity of hash
            functions, we have that the probability of false positives decreases
            as m increases and increases as n increases.
          </p>

          <p>
            The optimal number of hash functions k for given m and n, that
            minimize the false positive rate probability is
          </p>

          <img
            src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:502/format:webp/1*BveUhKacg2a0xfrQIJRf8w.png"
            alt="Optimal k"
          />

          <p>
            By doing some mathematics, we can easily achieve the optimal number
            of hash functions and bit array length for a given false positive
            rate like the below:
          </p>

          <img
            src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:464/format:webp/1*4O7VO0YNF4HQu91ipLYvwA.png"
            alt="Optimal m and k"
          />

          <img
            src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:514/format:webp/1*g5_DHZCSCfGrZCqe8XJ-4Q.png"
            alt="Optimal m and k"
          />

          <p>
            This means that for a given false positive rate, the length of the
            boom filter array m is proportionate to the number of elements being
            filtered, and the number of hash functions only depends on the
            target false positive rate.
          </p>

          <p>Predicting the value m and l for a given application:</p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              Estimate the number of elements (n) your system is going to handle
              in the future.
            </li>
            <li>
              Determine the false positive rate appropriate to your application.
              Be cautious when choosing a low false positive rate, it can
              increase the bit array size.
            </li>
            <li>
              Calculate the bit array size using estimated n and false positive
              rate. Which can affect the space complexity of the filter.
            </li>
            <li>
              Calculate the value k using a false positive rate. Which can
              affect the time complexity of the filter.
            </li>
          </ol>

            For 1,000,000,000 elements (n = 1000000000) and a 1% false positive
            rate (e = 0.01),
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Bit array size (m</strong>) = 9585058377.37 = 8.9268 GB
            nearly
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>The number of hash functions (k) </strong>= 6.64 = 7 hash
            functions.
          </p>

          <p>
            So, an<strong> 8.92 GB</strong> bit array with
            <strong>7 hash functions</strong> is enough for maintaining a
            <strong> 1% false positive rate</strong> for a system with a
            <strong>billion elements.</strong>
          </p>

          <h2>Bloom Filter Applications</h2>

          <ol>
            <li>
              The famous content delivery provider Akamai Technologies uses a
              bloom filter to prevent â€˜One-Hit Wondersâ€™ from being stored in its
              disk caches. One hit wonder are web resources requested by the
              user just once. Something that Akamai found applied to nearly
              three-quarters of their caching infrastructure. Using bloom
              filters to detect a second request for a web resource and caching
              that resource only prevents one-hit wonders from entering disk
              caches significantly.
            </li>

            <li>
              The Google Chrome web browser previously used the bloom filter for
              its Safe Browsing feature to identify malicious URLs. The bloom
              filter helps quickly check if a URL is potentially harmful without
              sending the actual URL to Google servers.
            </li>

            <li>
              The medium used bloom filters in its recommendation systems to
              avoid showing those articles that have already been seen by the
              user.
            </li>

            <li>
              Google Big Table, HBase Apache Cassandra, PostgreSQL, and ScyllaDB
              use bloom filters to reduce the disk lookups for non-existent rows
              and columns by improving the query performance.
            </li>

            <li>
              Bitcoin uses Bloom Filters to speed up wallet synchronization
              until privacy vulnerabilities with the implementation of the Bloom
              Filter were discovered.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <h2>Drawbacks of Bloom Filters</h2>

          <ul>
            <li>
              False positive: highlighted downside of the bloom filter while it
              canâ€™t be avoided by nature. But it can be reduced using optimal
              parameters.
            </li>
            <li>
              Need for multiple hash functions: bloom filter needs independent,
              uniformly distributed hash functions that are relatively easy to
              calculate to maintain the efficiency of hashing. Finding such hash
              functions could be a complex task.
            </li>
            <li>
              Inflexibility: The size of the bit array is fixed. It cannot be
              shrunk or expanded during production. It must be designated during
              its development time. For the bloom filter to be successful, the
              amount of data that will be added to the system must be stated or
              made obvious in advance.
            </li>
            <li>
              Only existing probability can be obtained from the filter, not the
              original data (nevertheless, this is not a requirement of a bloom
              filter).
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Use Cases of Bloom Filters</h2>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Checking for email ID/username availability:</strong> for
              large-scale systems with billions of records, checking the
              availability of usernames in its distributed data storage systems
              would be impractical with thousands of requests per second. Bloom
              filters can permit the system to roughly estimate the individual
              IDâ€™s availability.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Recommending New Content</strong>: Large content streaming
              systems like Medium store their content distributed across data
              centers around the world. So, when an algorithm proposes content
              for a user, it is impractical to crunch the database to check
              whether the user has already viewed that content before. Bloom
              filters can help at that point.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Cache Filtering:</strong> Content Delivery Networks deploy
              their web caches around the world to cache and serve web resources
              to users with greater performance and reliability. Analysis shows
              that nearly three-quarters of the URLs accessed from a typical web
              cache are â€œOne Hit Wonders"â€”that are accessed by only one and
              never again. Itâ€™s wasteful of disk capacity to store one-hit
              wonders on a cache system. To prevent one-hit wonders from
              entering the web cache, we can deploy a bloom filter to keep track
              of the web URLs that are accessed by users. A web resource is
              cached only when it has been accessed at least once before,
              significantly reducing the write workload on the disks.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Ensuring the security level of a suspicious URL:</strong>
              If youâ€™ve deployed a cloud security system that prevents you from
              viewing malicious URLs. This service could store an archive of
              billions of potentially hazardous URLs and process several
              millions of requests per minute. In this situation, looking for a
              database or cache is impossible. Bloom filter can be used to
              probabilistically check the URLâ€™s security.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Counting Bloom Filter</h2>

          <p>
            One significant drawback of the simple bloom filter is that once we
            add an element to the set, we canâ€™t remove it from it. Either we
            have to rebuild the entire bloom filter from scratch or we have to
            acknowledge the element persistent in the set forever. Counting
            bloom filter is an extension for the bloom filter which provides a
            way to implement a delete operation on a bloom filter without
            creating a bloom filter fresh.
          </p>

          <p>
            In a counting bloom filter, single-bit array positions are extended
            to multi-bit array positions. The insertion operation is extended to
            increment the value of each array position the membership check
            process checks that each of the hashed positions is non-zero. The
            delete operation consists of decrementing the value of each hashed
            array position.
          </p>

          <p>
            Arithmetic overflow of array positions is a problem and the array
            position should be large enough to make this rare. Because using a
            multi-bit array counting bloom filter consumes more space than a
            simple bloom filter.
          </p>

          <h2>Conclusion</h2>

          <p>
            The Bloom filter is a highly efficient probabilistic data structure
            designed for set membership testing in scenarios where traditional
            data structures would require impractically large amounts of memory.
            It offers constant-time performance for both inserting and querying
            elements, making it ideal for applications with significant memory
            constraints.
          </p>

          <p>
            Real-world applications of Bloom filters include Google Chromeâ€™s
            Safe Browsing feature, Akamaiâ€™s CDN caching filtering, the Medium
            recommendation system, Wallet synchronization in Bitcoin, and
            database querying. Designing an effective Bloom filter involves
            making trade-offs, such as selecting suitable hash functions,
            determining optimal filter parameters for specific contexts, and
            addressing design issues. However, through careful calculation and
            analysis, it is possible to significantly reduce the false positive
            rate.
